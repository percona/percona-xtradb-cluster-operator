**Description**

I'm DevOps engineer and have an interest in Kubernetes and its operators.
Running three-sites Kubernetes project where PXC Operator is successfully operating over VPN/Wireguard.
The initial goal is to expand DevOps knowledge, learn networking, operators, solve clustering problems, prepare for CKA exam, etc.

A fan of idea to move DBs to Kubernetes.
