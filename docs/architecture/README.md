## Architecture Decision Records

We will record design decisions for the architecture to ensure we preserve the context of our
choices. These will be written in the format proposed in the
[blog post by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

Please see the [architectural decision log](decisions/index.md) for the list of all ADRs.
